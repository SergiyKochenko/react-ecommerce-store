## Authentication - Access & Refresh Tokens

The application uses **JWT-based authentication** with access and refresh tokens to ensure secure and efficient user authentication.

### Access Token
- The access token is a short-lived token (15 minutes) used to authenticate API requests.
- It is stored in an HTTP-only cookie to prevent XSS attacks.

### Refresh Token
- The refresh token is a long-lived token (7 days) used to generate new access tokens.
- It is stored in an HTTP-only cookie and managed securely in **Upstash Redis**.
- The refresh token is deleted from Redis upon logout to prevent reuse.

### Authentication Flow
1. **Signup/Login**:
   - Users receive an access token and a refresh token upon successful signup or login.
   - Tokens are set as HTTP-only cookies.

2. **Access Token Expiry**:
   - When the access token expires, the client sends a request to the `/api/auth/refresh-token` endpoint.
   - A new access token is generated if the refresh token is valid.

3. **Logout**:
   - The `/api/auth/logout` endpoint clears both tokens from cookies and deletes the refresh token from Redis.

### Upstash Redis Integration
- The application uses **Upstash Redis** to securely store and manage refresh tokens.
- Visit [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/) to monitor and manage your Redis database.

### Environment Variables
Ensure the following environment variables are set in the `.env` file:
```
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=<your-access-token-secret>
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=<your-refresh-token-secret>
UPSTASH_REDIS_URL=<your-upstash-redis-url>
```

## Product Routes

The application provides a set of routes to manage products, including fetching, creating, updating, and deleting products. It integrates with **Upstash Redis** for caching and **Cloudinary** for image storage.

   - Fetches all products from the database.

2. **Get Featured Products**  
   `GET /api/products/featured`  
   - Fetches featured products.
